# Now we have a more complex scenario. 
# We have several objects of the same colour, i.e. 5 yellow balls.
# They are diposed around the scene having diferent sizes.
# What we want now is to track the only one that is moving around, no matter its size.
# Goals:
#
#    Step 1: 	Basic motion detection
#
#    Step 2: 	Detect the presence of colored objects using computer vision techniques.
#
#    Step 3: 	Track the object as it moves around in the video frames, 
#				drawing its previous positions as it moves, creating a tail behind it
